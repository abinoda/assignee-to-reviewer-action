# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Run a multi-line script
      run: |
        echo Add other actions to build,
        echo test, and deploy your project.

Export all your WordPress data to Ghost in a couple of clicks!

== Description ==

### Ghost Migrator: The easy way to migrate data to Ghost

The official Ghost plugin allows you to export your WordPress data in a JSON format that can be imported quickly and easily by the [Ghost](https://ghost.org) publishing platform.

#### Features Overview

The Ghost Migrator plugin will export as much blog and publication data as it can into a clean set of exported files.

- Posts, pages, tags and authors are all automatically exported and recreated for Ghost
- Tags will be migrated, but not categories. If needed you can [convert your categories to tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/) before exporting.
- Ghost does not have built-in comments, but it does integrate with [many comment platforms](https://ghost.org/integrations/community/) if you want to migrate your comments there.
- No custom fields, meta, shortcodes, post types, taxonomies or binary files will be migrated. Just regular **posts**, **pages**, **tags** and **images**
- Passwords are not migrated - after importing to Ghost, each user may perform a password reset to gain access to their Ghost account

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =

* Added check/notice for ZipArchive.
* Added check/notice for minimum PHP version.
* Added diagnostics section.

= 1.0.0 =

* Updated export format to support Ghost 2.x & 3.x
* Updated slug to use user_nicename.
* Upload/image URLs are now exported as relative paths compatible with Ghost.
* The download archive now includes all images in a Ghost compatible directory structure.
* Added user profile image, updated name to use display_name, and updated the post feature image field. Props to badrihippo.

= 0.5.6 =

* Added permission check for downloading the exported data. Only users allowed to do that can download it. Props tomhallam.

= 0.5.5 =
* Added 'the_content' filter around $post->content. Helps with markdown conversion and display issues

= 0.5.4 =
* new line tweaks: h1 and h2 will be prepended by new lines now. Previously they weren't, and that caused problems with opening a new tag for the headers.
* set h1 and h2 to use atx method (# and ## instead of underlining with === and ---)
* tweaked code block: multiple lines of code blocks are exported wrapped with ticks instead of being indented by one tab character. Code spans not changed.
* shout out to sorbolene on #ghost for taking the time to nag me about this :) Thanks!

= 0.5.3 =
* implemented HTML to Markdown (thanks @yauh!). Ref: https://github.com/nickcernis/html2markdown/
* code lint: plugin now adheres to WordPress-Extra coding style
* added featured image to the export

= 0.5.2 =
* Restricting fields to fit within Ghost's db schema (concatenating some of the fields):
* title and slug are both capped at 150 characters
* status is capped at 150 characters (although you'd only every use about 15)
* language is capped at 6 (although most are 5, like "en_GB" or 2)

= 0.5.1 =
* Housekeeping in the repository.

= 0.5.0 =
* Added support for multi-user capabilities, it now exports users, and connects posts with the users
* Now exports pages
* Exports user meta
* Moved the json file save directory to the uploads folder. Added check whether the folder is writable or not.

= 0.4.3 =
* Added support for `private` and `pending` WordPress post statuses (which were unhandled, and thus broke import). Ref: [WP Query: Status Parameters](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Status_Parameters)

= 0.4.2 =
* Removed published_at date from draft posts

= 0.4.1 =
* Bumped version to current stable Ghost version
* Added Export link to plugin row display for easier access
* Changed date format in exported JSON. Previously it was microtime, which caused troubles on 32 bit PHP installs, as the maximum integer was less than current time, so exports were either in scientific notation or string. Currently using RFC2822 format (date("r") for the devs), which works with the importer

= 0.3.0 =
* Fixes a bug where future posts would crash the plugin, and you weren't able to export
* Future posts are exported as drafts. Their published_at retains the future publish datetime though
* Updated version to 0.3.0 for semver reasons
* Left out Bond version :(

= 0.0.6 =
* Fixes a duplicate tag issue.

= 0.0.5 =
* Removed the export of Categories so that duplicate slugs don't happen if there is a tag and a category with the same name.

= 0.0.4 =
* There was a schema change in 0.3.2 or somewhere near that. Basically the way tags work changed, thus the exporter had to be reworked.

= 0.0.3 =
* Fixed a typo I left in the previous version causing everything to not work... Sorry...

= 0.0.2 =
* Fixed a path issue that would sometimes result in empty .json files. Hat tip to Ian Wootten for the fix!

= 0.0.1 =
* Initial implementation
